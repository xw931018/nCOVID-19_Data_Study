# nCOVID-19_Data_Study
A study on confirmed case number of nCOVID-19

This repository includes simple curve fits by country using the daily confirmed cases number. 

Three functions are used to fit curves: arctan, sigmoid, and a linear combination of arctan and sigmoid.

Data comes from DingXiangYuan public data, which is available in https://github.com/BlankerL/DXY-COVID-19-Data

Fitted results can be found in the folder Fitted_Curve
